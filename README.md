Note: Our models are trained on faces cropped by the dlib CNN face detector. Although in both scripts we included the --no_crop option to run the models without face crops, it is used for images with already cropped faces.

# Evaluate the dataset, run:

# Download the dataset
cd data
bash download_valset.sh
cd ..
# Run evaluation script. Model weights need to be downloaded.
